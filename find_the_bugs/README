bug04/:  Assume 64bit operating system - why does the program segfault? 
         func.c will be compiled as an object, caller.c is compiled as an
         executable and linked with caller.o.

         Try without compiling. If stuck, go ahead and compile. (run ./make.sh) 

bug05.c: Why does this code not compile? What is the fix? (There are two ways,
         but only one is optimal)

bug06.c: What is the output of this program?
